# XYPenPlotter
This is code used to run a simple XY Penplotter of H-Bot Mechanism. It is simple and enables it to draw a Nikolas Haus in one cycle.
The plotter was designed in solidworks from scratch and 3D printed in our lab. 
The perfect dimension and appropriate design (to withstand forces) was achieved through learninings and many iterations.
Finally ESP32, L293D motor driver and TT Motors were incorporated and coding process was started.
Response of motors was analyzed and appropriate delays were set to achieve the goal.
